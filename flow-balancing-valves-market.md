<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flow Balancing Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Balancing Valves</li><li>Automatic Balancing Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flow balancing valves are critical in HVAC systems for regulating and optimizing flow rates. Manual balancing valves require manual adjustment to achieve desired flow, offering simplicity and reliability for straightforward systems. In contrast, automatic balancing valves autonomously manage flow variations, ensuring consistent performance without the need for frequent human intervention. This makes them ideal for complex systems where maintaining precise flow dynamics is essential. Both types contribute to energy efficiency and system longevity by preventing over or under-utilization of resources.</p></p>
