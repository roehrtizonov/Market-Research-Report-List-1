<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Excavators OTR Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The excavator OTR tire market is primarily divided into two types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires feature a construction where the cords are placed at a 90-degree angle to the direction of travel, offering improved stability, longer tread life, and better fuel efficiency. On the other hand, bias tires have cords arranged diagonally, providing robustness and excellent load-carrying capabilities but typically at the cost of reduced traction and durability compared to radial options. Each type serves specific operational needs in the excavation sector.</p></p>
