<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Lung Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bubble Artificial Lung</li><li>Membrane Artificial Lung</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial lung market comprises two primary types: bubble artificial lungs and membrane artificial lungs. Bubble artificial lungs utilize gas exchange through bubbles in liquid, facilitating oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal, often employed in temporary settings. In contrast, membrane artificial lungs feature a semi-permeable membrane that allows gas exchange while separating blood from gas, providing more efficient and compact solutions for long-term use. Both types serve critical roles in supporting patients with respiratory failure or during surgical procedures.</p></p>
